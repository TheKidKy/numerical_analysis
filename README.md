# Numerical Analysis
This repository is meant to provide numerical methods to solve math problems using Python based on already existing numerical approches.
Various algorithms are implemented in this project to approximate equations and problems which are not easily solvable by generic formulas.

## Contents
1. Root finding methods (Bisection, Secant, Newton's, .etc)
2. Interpolation methods (Lagrange Polynomials, Newton Divided Difference, Forward Difference, .etc)
3. Numerical Differentiation & Integeration (Trapezoid Rule, Simpson's Rule, .etc)
4. Systems Of Linear Equations (Direct Methods, Iterative Methods(
5. Numerical Solutions to Partial Differential Equations
6. Error Analysis
